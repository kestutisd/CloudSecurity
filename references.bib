abstract = {Cloud data migration is the procedure of moving information, localhost applications, services, and data to the distributed cloud computing infrastructure. The success of this data migration process is depending on several aspects like planning and impact analysis of existing enterprise systems. One of the most common operations is moving locally stored data in a public cloud computing environment. This paper, through a multivocal literature review, identifies the key advantages and consequences of migrating data into the cloud. There are five different cloud migration strategies and models prescribed to evaluate the performance, identifying security requirements, choosing a cloud provider, calculating the cost, and making any necessary organizational changes. The results of this research paper can give a road map for the data migration journey and can help decision makers towards a safe and productive migration to a cloud computing environment.}

In the cloud computing environment, it becomes particularly serious because the data is located in different places even in all the globe. Data security and privacy protection are the two main factors of user's concerns about the cloud technology. Though many techniques on the topics in cloud computing have been investigated in both academics and industries, data security and privacy protection are becoming more important for the future development of cloud computing technology in government, industry, and business. Data security and privacy protection issues are relevant to both hardware and software in the cloud architecture. This study is to review different security techniques and challenges from both software and hardware aspects for protecting data in the cloud and aims at enhancing the data security and privacy protection for the trustworthy cloud environment. In this paper, we make a comparative research analysis of the existing research work regarding the data security and privacy protection techniques used in the cloud computing. }

ABSTRACT = {Cloud computing is currently becoming a well-known buzzword in which business titans, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, among others, are at the forefront in developing and providing sophisticated cloud computing systems to their users in a cost-effective manner. Security is the biggest concern for cloud computing and is a major obstacle to users adopting cloud computing systems. Maintaining the security of cloud computing is important, especially for the infrastructure. Several research works have been conducted in the cloud infrastructure security area; however, some gaps have not been completely addressed, while new challenges continue to arise. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the security issues at different cloud infrastructure levels (e.g., application, network, host, and data). It investigates the most prominent issues that may affect the cloud computing business model with regard to infrastructure. It further discusses the current solutions proposed in the literature to mitigate the different security issues at each level. To assist in solving the issues, the challenges that are still unsolved are summarized. Based on the exploration of the current challenges, some cloud features such as flexibility, elasticity and the multi-tenancy are found to pose new challenges at each infrastructure level. More specifically, the multi-tenancy is found to have the most impact at all infrastructure levels, as it can lead to several security problems such as unavailability, abuse, data loss and privacy breach. This survey concludes by giving some recommendations for future research.},

ABSTRACT={With the significant growth of internet usage, people increasingly share their personal information online. As a result, an enormous amount of personal information and financial transactions become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Phishing is an example of a highly effective form of cybercrime that enables criminals to deceive users and steal important data. Since the first reported phishing attack in 1990, it has been evolved into a more sophisticated attack vector. At present, phishing is considered one of the most frequent examples of fraud activity on the Internet. Phishing attacks can lead to severe losses for their victims including sensitive information, identity theft, companies, and government secrets. This article aims to evaluate these attacks by identifying the current state of phishing and reviewing existing phishing techniques. Studies have classified phishing attacks according to fundamental phishing mechanisms and countermeasures discarding the importance of the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing. This article proposes a new detailed anatomy of phishing which involves attack phases, attackerâ€™s types, vulnerabilities, threats, targets, attack mediums, and attacking techniques. Moreover, the proposed anatomy will help readers understand the process lifecycle of a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of these phishing attacks and the techniques being used; also, it helps in developing a holistic anti-phishing system. Furthermore, some precautionary countermeasures are investigated, and new strategies are suggested.}

Once a vendor learns about a zero-day vulnerability, releasing a timely patch becomes a priority given the risk of zero-day exploits. However, we still lack information on the factors that affect patch release time of such vulnerabilities. The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of other as-yet unexplored factors on the patch release time of zero-day vulnerabilities. Using zero-day vulnerability dataset captured between 2010 and 2020, we employ survival analysis technique. Our model explores the impact of vulnerability attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, scope, confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact on patch release timing. Findings show that a zero-day vulnerability is more likely to be patched on time if the vulnerability results in a scope change and affects more vendors, products, and versions. However, a zero-day vulnerability is less likely to be patched on time if it requires privileges and impacts confidentiality. Our sub-analyses also reveal how patch release times vary across different products and vulnerability types.}",
