abstract = {Cloud data migration is the procedure of moving information, localhost applications, services, and data to the distributed cloud computing infrastructure. The success of this data migration process is depending on several aspects like planning and impact analysis of existing enterprise systems. One of the most common operations is moving locally stored data in a public cloud computing environment. This paper, through a multivocal literature review, identifies the key advantages and consequences of migrating data into the cloud. There are five different cloud migration strategies and models prescribed to evaluate the performance, identifying security requirements, choosing a cloud provider, calculating the cost, and making any necessary organizational changes. The results of this research paper can give a road map for the data migration journey and can help decision makers towards a safe and productive migration to a cloud computing environment.}

In the cloud computing environment, it becomes particularly serious because the data is located in different places even in all the globe. Data security and privacy protection are the two main factors of user's concerns about the cloud technology. Though many techniques on the topics in cloud computing have been investigated in both academics and industries, data security and privacy protection are becoming more important for the future development of cloud computing technology in government, industry, and business. Data security and privacy protection issues are relevant to both hardware and software in the cloud architecture. This study is to review different security techniques and challenges from both software and hardware aspects for protecting data in the cloud and aims at enhancing the data security and privacy protection for the trustworthy cloud environment. In this paper, we make a comparative research analysis of the existing research work regarding the data security and privacy protection techniques used in the cloud computing. }

ABSTRACT = {Cloud computing is currently becoming a well-known buzzword in which business titans, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, among others, are at the forefront in developing and providing sophisticated cloud computing systems to their users in a cost-effective manner. Security is the biggest concern for cloud computing and is a major obstacle to users adopting cloud computing systems. Maintaining the security of cloud computing is important, especially for the infrastructure. Several research works have been conducted in the cloud infrastructure security area; however, some gaps have not been completely addressed, while new challenges continue to arise. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the security issues at different cloud infrastructure levels (e.g., application, network, host, and data). It investigates the most prominent issues that may affect the cloud computing business model with regard to infrastructure. It further discusses the current solutions proposed in the literature to mitigate the different security issues at each level. To assist in solving the issues, the challenges that are still unsolved are summarized. Based on the exploration of the current challenges, some cloud features such as flexibility, elasticity and the multi-tenancy are found to pose new challenges at each infrastructure level. More specifically, the multi-tenancy is found to have the most impact at all infrastructure levels, as it can lead to several security problems such as unavailability, abuse, data loss and privacy breach. This survey concludes by giving some recommendations for future research.},

ABSTRACT={With the significant growth of internet usage, people increasingly share their personal information online. As a result, an enormous amount of personal information and financial transactions become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Phishing is an example of a highly effective form of cybercrime that enables criminals to deceive users and steal important data. Since the first reported phishing attack in 1990, it has been evolved into a more sophisticated attack vector. At present, phishing is considered one of the most frequent examples of fraud activity on the Internet. Phishing attacks can lead to severe losses for their victims including sensitive information, identity theft, companies, and government secrets. This article aims to evaluate these attacks by identifying the current state of phishing and reviewing existing phishing techniques. Studies have classified phishing attacks according to fundamental phishing mechanisms and countermeasures discarding the importance of the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing. This article proposes a new detailed anatomy of phishing which involves attack phases, attacker’s types, vulnerabilities, threats, targets, attack mediums, and attacking techniques. Moreover, the proposed anatomy will help readers understand the process lifecycle of a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of these phishing attacks and the techniques being used; also, it helps in developing a holistic anti-phishing system. Furthermore, some precautionary countermeasures are investigated, and new strategies are suggested.}

Once a vendor learns about a zero-day vulnerability, releasing a timely patch becomes a priority given the risk of zero-day exploits. However, we still lack information on the factors that affect patch release time of such vulnerabilities. The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of other as-yet unexplored factors on the patch release time of zero-day vulnerabilities. Using zero-day vulnerability dataset captured between 2010 and 2020, we employ survival analysis technique. Our model explores the impact of vulnerability attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, scope, confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact on patch release timing. Findings show that a zero-day vulnerability is more likely to be patched on time if the vulnerability results in a scope change and affects more vendors, products, and versions. However, a zero-day vulnerability is less likely to be patched on time if it requires privileges and impacts confidentiality. Our sub-analyses also reveal how patch release times vary across different products and vulnerability types.}",

Also, since the most devastating breaches are hacking breaches, we shed the light on type to unveil the most targeted organizations, and examine how the interest of hackers changes over time. On the other hand, the breaches caused by human factor are decreasing which can be explained by the awareness of employees and the application of security standards. This study would improve the state of knowledge about hacking breaches and help in securing organizations’ data by prioritizing the most attacked sectors.}

abstract = {Even though the cloud paradigm and its associated services has been adopted in various enterprise applications, there has been major issues with regard to authenticating users' critical data. Single Sign on (SSO) is a user authentication technique through which a server authenticates and allows a user to use a single aspect of login credentials, for example, to access multiple services in the cloud. Even though SSO reduces the number of logins that are needed over heterogeneous environments, the risk that might be associated with the security of SSO might be detrimental if, for example, a Man-in-the Middle (MITM) attacker manages to gain control of the SSO credentials. It is also possible to get the identity of the users who have logged into Active Directory or intranet and this identity can easily be used to log into other web-based applications, and this requires the use of the Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML). SAML is basically a standard that allows users to be logged into applications as per their sessions. The problem that this paper addresses is the lack of a proactive technique of hardening cloud-based SAML while combining SSO with a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) at the time of writing this paper. The authors have, therefore, proposed an effective approach that unifies SSO with MFA in this context. Based on the base score index conducted over Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the architecture proves to be reliable, feasible and with better performance.},

abstract = {OAuth 2.0 is a widely used authorization protocol for cloud based web services and is used by many big firms such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft for granting limited access to the data. OAuth 2.0 has a flexible design and can be implemented and configured in a number of ways according to the use case. However, each of these implementation decisions and configuration choices come with their respective security implications. In our research, we carry out a simulation of the OAuth 2.0 protocol and suggest additional features which can augment the architectural design and enhance overall security effectiveness of the protocol. The protocol classifies third-party client apps based on their ability to maintain the confidentiality of the secret keys and the method used by them to register with the authorization servers. The protocol further offers various options to send access tokens to third-party client apps. In our research, we suggest converging these different third-party client app types and implementation options into a single uniform client app type and operational flow, thereby reducing the complexity in decision making, implementation, security misconfigurations and maintenance of different codebases. We also propose incorporating 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) as a feature for authentication of third-party client apps in addition to the existing mechanism of basic authentication through client secret. We also advocate measures to utilize digital signatures and cryptography to mitigate the common risks and vulnerabilities associated with misuse of tokens, which are issued and exchanged at various stages of the OAuth process including access to protected resources.}
