<p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypts data transmitted over the Internet, ensuring that snoopers and hackers cannot view what you transmit. This is especially important for private and sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal communications. TLS originated from Secure Socket Layers (SSL), which was originally created to secure web sessions in 1994 by Netscape Communications Corporation. SSL 1.0 was never released publicly, while SSL 2.0 was rapidly superseded by SSL 3.0, the foundation for TLS. Historically, data was transferred unencrypted over the Internet, and encryption was often applied piecemeal to critical information such as passwords or payment information. Without TLS, not only may sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and personal information be easily gathered, but also surfing habits, e-mail conversations, online chats, and conference calls can be observed. By enabling TLS support in client and server apps, it ensures that data exchanged between them is encrypted using secure algorithms and is inaccessible to third parties.</p>
<p>TLS is the most frequently used encryption protocol in the internet. It is composed of two protocols: the TLS Handshake Protocol, which is responsible for authentication and key establishment, and the TLS Record Protocol, which is responsible for the subsequent usage of those keys to secure bulk data. SSL/TLS protects the confidentiality and integrity of data-in-transit by utilizing both asymmetric and symmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is used to establish a secure connection between a client and a server, and symmetric encryption is used to exchange data within the secured connection.</p>

</div>
<p>At a high level, TLS is split into two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A handshake phase where a secure communication is negotiated and created between two participants.</li>
<li>A post-handshake phase where communications are encrypted between the two participants.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">A handshake and post-handshake communitcation</p>
</div>
<p>TLS 1.2 and earlier versions perform the key exchange once both parties agree on the key exchange algorithm to use. This means they first agree on a method to utilize before exchanging public keys.</p>

</div>
<p>To eliminate the first round of negotiation (one client message and one server message) in TLS 1.3, the client transmits a public key speculatively in the very first message (the Client Hello). If the client is unable to correctly forecast the server’s key exchange mechanism, the client must send a new Client Hello with the right public key. TLS 1.3 contains numerous such enhancements that are critical for the web. Indeed, many people have insecure or poor connections, making it critical to restrict non-application communication to a bare minimum. Additionally, unlike prior versions of TLS, all key exchanges in TLS 1.3 are ephemeral. This means that for each new session, both the client and server generate new key pairs and then delete them immediately after the key exchange is complete <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wong" role="doc-biblioref">Wong 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>The handshake itself contains of these following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Negotiation. TLS is highly configurable. Both a client and a server can be configured to negotiate a range of SSL and TLS versions, as well as a menu of acceptable cryptographic algorithms. The negotiation phase of the handshake aims at finding common ground between the client’s and the server’s configurations, in order to securely connect the two peers.</li>
<li>Key exchange. The whole point of the handshake is to perform a key exchange between the two participants. What key exchange algorithm to use? This is one of the things decided as part of the negotiation process.</li>
<li>Authentication. It is trivial for a MITM attacker to impersonate any side of a key exchange. For this reason, key exchanges must be authenticated. (Your browser must have a way to make sure that it is talking to google.com and not your Internet service provider, for example.)</li>
<li>Session Resumption. As browsers often connect to the same websites again and again, key exchanges can be costly and slow down a user’s experience. For this reason, mechanisms to fast-track secure sessions without redoing a key exchange are integrated into TLS.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of TLS 1.3 a negotiation could be:</p>
<pre><code>* The client sends a TLS 1.3 Client Hello announcing that it can do either an 
* X25519 or an X448 key exchange together with a X25519 public key.
* The server does not support X25519, but does support X448. 
* It sends a Hello Retry Request to the client announcing that it only supports X448. 
* The client sends the same Client Hello but with an X448 public key instead. 
* The handshake goes on.</code></pre>
<p>RSA and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange are the two most widely used encryption algorithms, each of which solves the same problem in a somewhat different way. In a nutshell, the Diffie Hellman technique generates a public and private key for each party to the transaction but shares only the public key. Unlike Diffie-Hellman, the RSA algorithm can be used for both digital signatures and symmetric key exchange, although it does need the prior exchange of a public key. RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman—the three men who initially publicly defined the approach in 1977. RSA is based on the assumption that factoring really large integers is difficult (integer factorization). On the assumption that there is no efficient solution for integer factorization, it is thought that decrypting an RSA ciphertext completely is infeasible. A user of RSA generates and then publishes their public key, which is composed of two enormous prime integers and an auxiliary value. The primary variables must remain unidentified. While anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, only someone familiar with the prime factors is likely to be able to decrypt it.</p>
<p>The browser, on the other hand, verify that the handshake is happening between the client and specific website using the Public Key Infrastructure. Firstly, browsers must trust a set of root public keys - Certificate Authorities (CAs). Typically, browsers will either utilize a hardcoded list of trusted public keys or will request them from the operating system. Websites wishing to utilize HTTPS must be able to receive certification from one of these CAs (a signature of their signing public key). In order to do this, a website owner must prove to a CA that they own a specific domain. CAs do not directly sign public keys but rather sign certificates. A certificate contains both the long-term public key and some crucial metadata, such as the domain name of your web page, if you have one. To ensure that the server connecting with a browser is genuine, the server includes a certificate chain in the TLS handshake. This certificate chain is sent in a Certificate TLS message by the server, and by the client as well if the client has been asked to authenticate. The server sends this certificate chain in a Certificate TLS message, as does the client if the client is prompted to authenticate. Following the establishment of a handshake and the generation of symmetric keys, both the client and server can exchange encrypted application data. Additionally, TLS prevents reordering of such communications.</p>

<p>Authentication and trust mechanisms are needed by the user and provider alike. In this scenario, SSO could be a good starting point. The spam e-mail problem can be also mitigated in the cloud. While often used interchangeably, authentication and authorization represent fundamentally different functions. In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>OAuth 2.0: If you’ve ever signed up to a new application and agreed to let it automatically source new contacts via Facebook or your phone contacts, then you’ve likely used OAuth 2.0. This standard provides secure delegated access. That means an application can take actions or access resources from a server on behalf of the user, without them having to share their credentials. It does this by allowing the identity provider (IdP) to issue tokens to third-party applications with the user’s approval.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect: If you’ve used your Google to sign in to applications like YouTube, or Facebook to log into an online shopping cart, then you’re familiar with this authentication option. OpenID Connect is an open standard that organizations use to authenticate users. IdPs use this so that users can sign in to the IdP, and then access other websites and apps without having to log in or share their sign-in information.</p>
<p>SAML: You’ve more likely experienced SAML authentication in action in the work environment. For example, it enables you to log into your corporate intranet or IdP and then access numerous additional services, such as Salesforce, Box, or Workday, without having to re-enter your credentials. SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between IdPs and service providers to verify the user’s identity and permissions, then grant or deny their access to services.</p>
<div id="saml" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="5.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> SAML<a href="security-considerations.html#saml" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The SSO (Single Sign-on) and CAS (Central Authentication Service) should be also activated to make a user to access various software services through a single active user account. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cloudseclayers" role="doc-biblioref">Jangjou and Sohrabi 2022</a>)</span></p>
<p>SAML V1.0 became an OASIS standard in November 2002. SAML V1.1 followed in September 2003 and has seen significant success, gaining momentum in financial services, higher education, government, and other industry segments</p>
<p>with Redirect/POST Bind-ings and to the protocol which is distributed and used by Google’s partner companies to get full control over the au-thorization and authentication of hosted user accounts thatcan access web-based applications like Gmail or Google Cal-endar <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-SAML" role="doc-biblioref">Armando et al. 2008</a>)</span></p>
<p>the work presented by Thomas Grofi [6]presents a security analysis of the SAML Single Sign-on Browser/Artifact profile. SAML is an important standardized example of this new protocol class and will be widely used in business-to-business scenarios to reduce user-management costs. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-SSOSAML" role="doc-biblioref">Nongbri, Hadem, and Chettri 2018</a>)</span></p>
<p>Mainly used for Enterprise and Government applications, SAML 2.0 is a mature technology dating from 2005 and supports a wide range of identity functionality. SAML uses XML for its identity data format and simple HTTP or SOAP for data transport mechanisms. The service requesting and receiving data from the IdP is known as the Relying Party (RP). The user identity data, encapsulated in an XML document called the SAML Assertion, is in the form of attributes, e.g., email address, name, phone, etc.</p>
<p>Even though SSO reduces the number of logins that are needed over heterogeneous environments, the risk that might be associated with the security of SSO might be detrimental if, for example, a Man-in-the Middle (MITM) attacker manages to gain control of the SSO credentials. The problem that this paper addresses is the lack of a proactive technique of hardening cloud-based SAML while combining SSO with a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-SAMLSEC" role="doc-biblioref">Karie et al. 2020</a>)</span></p>
<p>SAML can provide a mechanism for federated identity.</p>
<p>which is specifically designed for SSO.</p>
<p>Service Provider (Resource Server) – this is the web-server you are trying to access information on.</p>
<p>Client – this is how the user is interacting with the Resource Server, like a web app being served through a web browser.</p>
<p>Identity Provider (Authorization Server) – this is the server that owns the user identities and credentials. It’s who the user actually authenticates with.</p>
<p>SAML has one feature that OAuth2 lacks: the SAML token contains the user identity information (because of signing). With OAuth2, you don’t get that out of the box, and instead, the Resource Server needs to make an additional round trip to validate the token with the Authorization Server.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with OAuth2 you can invalidate an access token on the Authorization Server, and disable it from further access to the Resource Server.</p>
<p>Both approaches have nice features and both will work for SSO. We have proved out both concepts in multiple languages and various kinds of applications. At the end of the day OAuth2 seems to be a better fit for our needs (since there isn’t an existing SAML infrastructure in place to utilize).</p>
<p>OAuth2 provides a simpler and more standardized solution which covers all of our current needs and avoids the use of workarounds for interoperability with native applications.</p>

<p>Unlike SAML, OAuth 2.0 (henceforth OAuth2), is a specification whose ink has barely dried (circa late 2012). It has the benefit of being recent and takes into consideration how the world has changed in the past eight years.</p>
<p>Mobile devices and native applications are prevalent today in ways that SAML could not anticipate in 2005.</p>

<p>The OAuth 2.0 protocol is one of the most widely deployed authorization/single sign-on (SSO) protocols and also serves as the foundation for the new SSO standard OpenID Connect. Despite the popularity
of OAuth, so far analysis efforts were mostly targeted at finding bugs in specific implementations and
were based on formal models which abstract from many web features or did not provide a formal treatment at all.</p>
<p>With the fixes applied, we were able to prove strong authorization, authentication, and session integrity
properties for OAuth 2.0. Our security analysis assumes that OAuth security recommendations and certain best practices are followed. We show that otherwise the security of OAuth cannot be guaranteed. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oauthsec" role="doc-biblioref">Fett, Küsters, and Schmitz 2016</a>)</span></p>
<p>OAuth 2.0 is a widely used authorization protocol for cloud based web services and is used by many big firms such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft for granting limited access to the data. OAuth 2.0 has a flexible design and can be implemented and configured in a number of ways according to the use case. However, each of these implementation decisions and configuration choices come with their respective security implications</p>
<p>We also propose incorporating 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) as a feature for authentication of third-party client apps in addition to the existing mechanism of basic authentication through client secret. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oautharch" role="doc-biblioref">Singh and Chaudhary 2022</a>)</span></p>

<p>Intruders can exploit the vulnerabilities of equipment of this layer, such as switches, routers, IDSs, and network-based IPSs, and execute attacks such as DoS, reply, and tampering Attacks. After successful access to this equipment, they can also exploit the vulnerabilities of the host layer and operate their malicious activities in this layer.</p>
<p>The other vulnerabilities of misconfiguration can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Activating unused ports of equipment</p>
<p>Opening ports and unnecessary services such as HTTP on equipment</p>
<p>No upgrade of firmware of equipment</p>
<p>No periodic use of security patches</p>
<p>No configuration of passwords in various work modes of equipment</p>
<p>Using unsecure remote protocols such as Telnet</p>
<p>No use of tunnel protocols, such as IP security, to encrypt users’ accounts and intranet traffic</p>
<p>All configurations should be recorded, maintained, and monitored under scheduled programs to prevent any error or misconfiguration.</p>
<p>In public cloud, which provides services such as IaaS, the provider should activate the SNMP in the equipment of this layer, including firewalls, switches, and IDPS, to log all security events, such as critical, errors, warnings, and alerts, and send the logfiles to a centralized logging server using SNMP</p>
<p>Logging the events such as successful/unsuccessful access of the users to the equipment, configurations, and malicious traffics, and storing the logfiles on a separate server with limited access over a long period of time.</p>
<p>This issue should be addressed and implemented between the cloud users and cloud service providers for appropriate monitoring of security events and logging the events at the network level as a part of the service agreement.</p>
