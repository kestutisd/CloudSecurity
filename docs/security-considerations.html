<p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypts data transmitted over the Internet, ensuring that snoopers and hackers cannot view what you transmit. This is especially important for private and sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal communications. TLS originated from Secure Socket Layers (SSL), which was originally created to secure web sessions in 1994 by Netscape Communications Corporation. SSL 1.0 was never released publicly, while SSL 2.0 was rapidly superseded by SSL 3.0, the foundation for TLS. Historically, data was transferred unencrypted over the Internet, and encryption was often applied piecemeal to critical information such as passwords or payment information. Without TLS, not only may sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and personal information be easily gathered, but also surfing habits, e-mail conversations, online chats, and conference calls can be observed. By enabling TLS support in client and server apps, it ensures that data exchanged between them is encrypted using secure algorithms and is inaccessible to third parties.</p>
<p>TLS is the most frequently used encryption protocol in the internet. It is composed of two protocols: the TLS Handshake Protocol, which is responsible for authentication and key establishment, and the TLS Record Protocol, which is responsible for the subsequent usage of those keys to secure bulk data. SSL/TLS protects the confidentiality and integrity of data-in-transit by utilizing both asymmetric and symmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is used to establish a secure connection between a client and a server, and symmetric encryption is used to exchange data within the secured connection.</p>

</div>
<p>At a high level, TLS is split into two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A handshake phase where a secure communication is negotiated and created between two participants.</li>
<li>A post-handshake phase where communications are encrypted between the two participants.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/handshake.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A handshake and post-handshake communitcation</p>
</div>
<p>TLS 1.2 and earlier versions perform the key exchange once both parties agree on the key exchange algorithm to use. This means they first agree on a method to utilize before exchanging public keys.</p>

</div>
<p>To eliminate the first round of negotiation (one client message and one server message) in TLS 1.3, the client transmits a public key speculatively in the very first message (the Client Hello). If the client is unable to correctly forecast the server’s key exchange mechanism, the client must send a new Client Hello with the right public key. TLS 1.3 contains numerous such enhancements that are critical for the web. Indeed, many people have insecure or poor connections, making it critical to restrict non-application communication to a bare minimum. Additionally, unlike prior versions of TLS, all key exchanges in TLS 1.3 are ephemeral. This means that for each new session, both the client and server generate new key pairs and then delete them immediately after the key exchange is complete <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wong" role="doc-biblioref">Wong 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>The handshake itself contains of these following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Negotiation. TLS is highly configurable. Both a client and a server can be configured to negotiate a range of SSL and TLS versions, as well as a menu of acceptable cryptographic algorithms. The negotiation phase of the handshake aims at finding common ground between the client’s and the server’s configurations, in order to securely connect the two peers.</li>
<li>Key exchange. The whole point of the handshake is to perform a key exchange between the two participants. What key exchange algorithm to use? This is one of the things decided as part of the negotiation process.</li>
<li>Authentication. It is trivial for a MITM attacker to impersonate any side of a key exchange. For this reason, key exchanges must be authenticated. (Your browser must have a way to make sure that it is talking to google.com and not your Internet service provider, for example.)</li>
<li>Session Resumption. As browsers often connect to the same websites again and again, key exchanges can be costly and slow down a user’s experience. For this reason, mechanisms to fast-track secure sessions without redoing a key exchange are integrated into TLS.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of TLS 1.3 a negotiation could be:</p>
<pre><code>* The client sends a TLS 1.3 Client Hello announcing that it can do either an 
* X25519 or an X448 key exchange together with a X25519 public key.
* The server does not support X25519, but does support X448. 
* It sends a Hello Retry Request to the client announcing that it only supports X448. 
* The client sends the same Client Hello but with an X448 public key instead. 
* The handshake goes on.</code></pre>
<p>RSA and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange are the two most widely used encryption algorithms, each of which solves the same problem in a somewhat different way. In a nutshell, the Diffie Hellman technique generates a public and private key for each party to the transaction but shares only the public key. Unlike Diffie-Hellman, the RSA algorithm can be used for both digital signatures and symmetric key exchange, although it does need the prior exchange of a public key. RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman—the three men who initially publicly defined the approach in 1977. RSA is based on the assumption that factoring really large integers is difficult (integer factorization). On the assumption that there is no efficient solution for integer factorization, it is thought that decrypting an RSA ciphertext completely is infeasible. A user of RSA generates and then publishes their public key, which is composed of two enormous prime integers and an auxiliary value. The primary variables must remain unidentified. While anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, only someone familiar with the prime factors is likely to be able to decrypt it.</p>
<p>The browser, on the other hand, verify that the handshake is happening between the client and specific website using the Public Key Infrastructure. Firstly, browsers must trust a set of root public keys - Certificate Authorities (CAs). Typically, browsers will either utilize a hardcoded list of trusted public keys or will request them from the operating system. Websites wishing to utilize HTTPS must be able to receive certification from one of these CAs (a signature of their signing public key). In order to do this, a website owner must prove to a CA that they own a specific domain. CAs do not directly sign public keys but rather sign certificates. A certificate contains both the long-term public key and some crucial metadata, such as the domain name of your web page, if you have one. To ensure that the server connecting with a browser is genuine, the server includes a certificate chain in the TLS handshake. This certificate chain is sent in a Certificate TLS message by the server, and by the client as well if the client has been asked to authenticate. The server sends this certificate chain in a Certificate TLS message, as does the client if the client is prompted to authenticate. Following the establishment of a handshake and the generation of symmetric keys, both the client and server can exchange encrypted application data. Additionally, TLS prevents reordering of such communications.</p>

<p>Authentication and trust mechanisms are needed by the user and provider alike. In this scenario, SSO could be a good starting point. The spam e-mail problem can be also mitigated in the cloud. Despite their frequent interchangeability, authentication and permission serve fundamentally distinct purposes. Authentication is the process of validating a user’s identity, whereas authorization is the process of checking the user’s access rights. As a general recommendation, the SSO (Single Sign-on) and CAS (Central Authentication Service) should be also activated to make a user to access various software services through a single active user account. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cloudseclayers" role="doc-biblioref">Jangjou and Sohrabi 2022</a>)</span></p>
<p><img src="img/Authentication_vs_Authorization.png" alt="Authentication vs. Authorization - source www.okta.com" />
SAML and OAUTH2 are two of the most popular Single Sign-On implementation methods.</p>
<div id="saml" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> SAML<a href="security-considerations.html#saml" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>SAML is an abbreviation for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). Its principal function in terms of online security is to permit access to different web applications with a single set of login credentials. It operates by exchanging authentication data between two parties, often an identity provider (idP) and a web application. Web applications utilize SAML to send authentication data between two parties - the identity provider (IdP) and the service provider - in an XML-based format (SP). SAML was developed by the technology sector to ease the authentication procedure for users requiring access to various, independent web apps across domains. Single sign-on (SSO) was possible before SAML, but it relied on cookies that were only valid within the same domain. It accomplishes this by centralizing user authentication through an identity provider. Then, Web apps can utilize SAML via the identity provider to provide their users access. This SAML authentication method eliminates the need for users to memorize numerous login credentials. It also benefits service providers because it enhances the security of their own platform, especially by eliminating the need to retain (often insecure and weak) passwords and eliminating forgotten password difficulties. SAML V1.0 became an OASIS standard in November 2002. SAML V1.1 followed in September 2003 and has seen significant success, gaining momentum in financial services, higher education, government, and other industry segments. SAML is an important standardized example of this new protocol class and will be widely used in business-to-business scenarios to reduce user-management costs. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-SSOSAML" role="doc-biblioref">Nongbri, Hadem, and Chettri 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">SAML 2.0 Flow - source www.mutuallyhuman.com</p>
</div>
<p>Even though SSO reduces the number of logins that are needed over heterogeneous environments, the risk that might be associated with the security of SSO might be detrimental if, for example, a Man-in-the Middle (MITM) attacker manages to gain control of the SSO credentials. The problem that a paper addresses is the lack of a proactive technique of hardening cloud-based SAML while combining SSO with a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-SAMLSEC" role="doc-biblioref">Karie et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>with Redirect/POST Bindings and to the protocol which is distributed and used by Google’s partner companies to get full control over the authorization and authentication of hosted user accounts that can access web-based applications like Gmail or Google Calendar <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-SAML" role="doc-biblioref">Armando et al. 2008</a>)</span></p>
<p>SAML, however, provides a feature that OAuth2 does not: the SAML token contains user identification information (because of signing). With OAuth2, this is not provided by default; instead, the Resource Server must make an additional round trip to the Authorization Server to validate the token.</p>
</div>
<div id="oauth2" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> OAuth2<a href="security-considerations.html#oauth2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>OAuth 2.0 (henceforth OAuth2) is a much more recent specification than SAML (circa late 2012). It has the advantage of being recent and takes into account the changes in the world during the past eight years. OAuth2 offers a simpler and more standardized solution that satisfies all of our existing requirements and eliminates the need for interoperability workarounds with native applications.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/oauth.PNG" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OAuth 2.0 Flow - source www.mutuallyhuman.com</p>
</div>
<p>OAuth 2.0 is one of the most extensively used authorization/single sign-on (SSO) protocols and serves as the foundation for the new SSO standard OpenID Connect. OAuth 2.0 is also popular for cloud-based online services and is used by many large companies, like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, to allow restricted access to data. OAuth 2.0 has a flexible architecture and may be implemented and customized in a variety of ways based on the use case.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, each of these implementation decisions and configuration options has its own security implications. Despite OAuth’s popularity, analysis attempts to date have focused primarily on discovering faults in individual implementations and have relied on formal models that abstract from numerous web aspects or have not provided a formal approach.</p>
<p>four major attack types are still feasible if the security recommendations and certain best practices are followed, e.g. 307 redirect attack, IdP mix-up attack, state leak attack, and naive RP session integrity attack <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oauthsec" role="doc-biblioref">Fett, Küsters, and Schmitz 2016</a>)</span>. In addition to the current approach of basic authentication via client secret, it is recommended to add 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) as a feature for third-party client app authentication. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oautharch" role="doc-biblioref">Singh and Chaudhary 2022</a>)</span></p>

<p>Providing secure services requires the setup of cloud infrastructure security policies appropriately. After gaining access to this equipment, they are able to attack the host layer’s weaknesses and conduct malicious operations in this layer. Other misconfiguration vulnerabilities can be characterized as follows <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cloudseclayers" role="doc-biblioref">Jangjou and Sohrabi 2022</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activating unused ports of equipment</li>
<li>Opening ports and unnecessary services such as HTTP on equipment</li>
<li>No upgrade of firmware of equipment</li>
<li>No periodic use of security patches</li>
<li>No configuration of passwords in various work modes of equipment</li>
<li>Using unsecure remote protocols such as Telnet</li>
<li>No use of tunnel protocols, such as IP security, to encrypt users’ accounts and intranet traffic</li>

<p>All configurations should be recorded, maintained, and monitored under scheduled programs to prevent any error or misconfiguration which is fairly easy to achieve using the cloud services and infrastructure as code approach.</p>
<p>Logging the events such as successful/unsuccessful access of the users to the equipment, configurations, and malicious traffics, and storing the logfiles on a separate server with limited access over a long period of time.

<p>When it comes to networking, logical isolation makes a VPC environment inherently more secure. However, public cloud security isn’t automatic, even with VPC – it must be intentionally deployed. Cloud security is always a shared responsibility between a cloud provider and its clients.</p>
